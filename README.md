# CNC-Router-Cutting-Path-File-Mandala-Design-Digital-Download-Part1
This is a digital cut file created for CNC router machines. The file contains a detailed mandala design with a precise cutting path program generated in G-code (.nc) format, customized according to machine specifications.  The intricate geometric mandala pattern is ideal for wood, acrylic, or foam board carving,producing a clean and elegant relief effect.
An accompanying .STL file is included for 3D preview, editing, or toolpath simulation.

File Formats:

G-code (.nc) – ready to use on compatible CNC routers

STL – 3D model file

Perfect for:
Decorative wall panels, furniture inlays, laser or CNC art projects, and architectural ornamentation.
